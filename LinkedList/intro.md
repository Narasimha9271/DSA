#### Linked List

| Advantages                                    | Disadvantages                                 |
| --------------------------------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| 1. Dynamic Nature                             | 1. More memory usage due to address pointer   |
| 2. Optimal insertion & deletion               | 2. Slow traversal compared to arrays          |
| 3. Stack's & queues can be easily implemented | 3. No reverse traversal in singly linked list |
| 4. No memory wastage                          | 4. No random access                           |

#### Types of LinkedList

**Singly-linked list**: linked list in which each node points to the next node and the last node points to null
**Doubly-linked list**: linked list in which each node has two pointers, p and n, such that p points to the previous node and n points to the next node; the last node's n pointer points to null
**Circular-linked list**: linked list in which each node points to the next node and the last node points back to the first node

#### Time Complexity:

-   Access: O(n)
-   Search: O(n)
-   Insert: O(1)
-   Remove: O(1)
